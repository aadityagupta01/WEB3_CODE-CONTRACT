# 💰 LoanChain – Immutable Loan Record Smart Contract

### 🧾 Project Description
**LoanChain** is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract designed to keep an **immutable on-chain record** of all borrowed and repaid funds.  
It acts as a transparent ledger where every loan and repayment is permanently stored on the blockchain — ensuring **trust, transparency, and immutability** between parties.

This project is perfect for developers learning how to:
- Use **structs**, **arrays**, and **events** in Solidity  
- Store and retrieve on-chain data  
- Create transparent and auditable financial records

### ⚙️ What It Does
LoanChain allows any user to:
1. **Borrow** a certain amount (logged as a “Borrowed” transaction)  
2. **Repay** a certain amount (logged as a “Repaid” transaction)  
3. **View** their loan history directly on the blockchain  

Every action is recorded immutably — meaning once a transaction is stored, it can never be modified or deleted.

### ✨ Features
- 🧱 **Immutable Records:** Every loan or repayment entry is permanently stored.  
- 👁️ **Public Transparency:** Anyone can view records on-chain.  
- ⏱️ **Timestamped Entries:** Each transaction includes an automatic blockchain timestamp.  
- 🔒 **Tamper-Proof:** No one (not even the contract owner) can modify previous records.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight Design:** Simple and gas-efficient — great for beginners.
